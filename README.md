VintageVinyl is a desktop application for managing personal vinyl record collections. 
With an embedded SQLite database and Discogs connectivity, the application allows users to: 
- catalog their personal record collection
- track projected market values
- research and maintain an album wishlist

VintageVinyl connects to the Discogs API using OAuth 1.0a authorization via the user's personal Discogs account.

Note: I am currently tracking down a viable option for storing and accessing Discogs API secrets.
